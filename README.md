# A-Visualizer
@Author: Adam Kristoph Fuzesi
@Description: Developed an interactive pathfinding algorithm visualizer in Python, using the PyGame library to create a dynamic simulation environment. The program features user-customizable parameters, enabling the adjustment of start and end points, and the
placement of obstacles within the grid. Additionally, it offers a selection of pre-designed grid layouts I made for an easy-to-use testing environment.
